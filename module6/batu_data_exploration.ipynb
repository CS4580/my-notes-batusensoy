    "- Strength of Correlation: The correlation coefficient ranges from -1 to 1. In this case, -0.194391 is relatively close to 0, indicating a weak correlation. This means that while there is some relationship, it is not strong enough to imply a significant impact of category on discounts.\n",

    "## Analysis\n",
    "The analysis reveals significant disparities in average discounts among different product categories. The category with the highest average discount is Electronics|WearableTechnology|SmartWatches, boasting an impressive average discount of approximately 69.82%. This suggests that products within this category are often heavily discounted, potentially to stimulate sales in a competitive market. In contrast, the category with the lowest average discount is Electronics|Mobiles&Accessories|Smartphones, with an average discount of only about 23.29%. This smaller discount may indicate a more stable pricing strategy, possibly reflecting higher demand or a premium pricing model for smartphones.\n",
    "\n",
    "The observed slight negative correlation coefficient of -0.194391 between category and average discount suggests that as the category code increases, representing a different grouping of products, the average discount tends to decrease slightly. However, this correlation is weak, indicating that the relationship between category and discounts is not robust and implies that other factors, such as market trends, consumer preferences, or promotional strategies, could significantly influence discount rates across categories. Further analysis may be warranted to understand these dynamics better and identify other variables affecting discount strategies.\n",
