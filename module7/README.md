# Module 7 Notes: Metrics and Model Development

## Metrics

Metrics should be `unbiased`, `universal`, and `concise`

    1. A way to observe similar responses
    2. A way to measure the performance
    3. A way to measure prediction

For our sample analysis we will use `KNN`K-Nearest Neighbor
- `K` is an arbitrary pick
- Need a `base case`
- Compare the neighbors
- Sort the results

Dataset for this analysis:
```bash
icarus.cs.weber.edu:~hvalle/cs4580/data/movies.csv
```
### KNN-Euclidean Distance
The Euclidean distance is the distance between points
in `N-dimensional` space.

Formula
$
d(p,q) = \sqrt{\sum_{i=1}^n (q_i - p_i)^2}
$
where:
- $p = (p_1, p_2, \dots, p_n)$
- $q = (q_1, q_2, \dots, q_n)$

#### Task:
Find the distance between these points:
- x = (0,0)
- y = (4,4)

Distance = 5.6565...

```

### KNN with Jaccard Similarity Index
Compares members of two individual sets to determine which members are `shared` and which are `distinct`. The index measures the similarity between the two sets.

$$
J(A,B) = \frac{|A \cap B|}{ |A \cup B|}
$$

Ex: $A = {1, 2, 3, 4}$ and $B= {3, 4, 5, 6}$ = $\frac{2}{6}$
